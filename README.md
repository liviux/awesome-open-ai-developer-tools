## Coding Agents & Pair Programmers

Agents that read, write, and refactor code in your repo.

### [aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · CLI · 🟡 active

AI pair programming in your terminal. Maps your whole repository, edits files directly, and writes its own git commits.

- **Replaces:** GitHub Copilot, Cursor
- **Backends:** 100+ models via LiteLLM — Claude, GPT, Gemini, plus local models through Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Edge:** The repo map gives it whole-codebase context without dumping every file into the prompt. Auto-commits mean every AI edit is a revertable checkpoint. Editor-agnostic — works alongside VS Code, Neovim, Emacs, or nothing at all.

### [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · TUI · 🟢 stable

Terminal-native coding agent with LSP integration — it loads the right language server so the model sees real type information, not guesses.

- **Replaces:** Claude Code, Cursor
- **Backends:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, local models; provider-agnostic by design
- **Edge:** LSP-grounded suggestions cut hallucinated APIs. Client/server split means you can drive one session from multiple clients.

### [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · VS Code extension · 🟢 stable

Autonomous coding agent inside VS Code. Plans, edits files, runs terminal commands, and uses the browser — asking permission at each step.

- **Replaces:** Cursor Composer, Devin
- **Backends:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, AWS Bedrock, Azure, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio
- **Edge:** Human-in-the-loop by default — every file diff and shell command needs approval. Plan/Act mode separation stops the agent from bulldozing a codebase.

### [Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · VS Code + JetBrains · 🟢 stable

Build your own AI code assistant — autocomplete, chat, and edit, configured with your own models and context providers.

- **Replaces:** GitHub Copilot
- **Backends:** Any — local (Ollama, llama.cpp) or hosted
- **Edge:** Fully configurable context providers (docs, terminal, git diff, codebase). Tab-autocomplete works well with small local models, so you can run genuinely offline.

### [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)
`Python` · `MIT` · Web + headless · 🟢 stable

Agents that do what a developer does — modify code, run commands, browse the web, call APIs — inside a sandboxed runtime.

- **Replaces:** Devin
- **Backends:** Anything LiteLLM supports
- **Edge:** Real sandboxed execution (Docker) rather than a chat that pretends to run things. Headless and CLI modes make it scriptable in CI.

### [SWE-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent)
`Python` · `MIT` · CLI · 🟡 active

Research-grade agent that turns a GitHub issue into a pull request.

- **Replaces:** Devin, issue-to-PR bots
- **Edge:** The agent-computer interface (ACI) is the point — carefully designed tools beat a bigger model. If you're building your own agent, read this codebase first.

### [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose)
`Rust` · `Apache-2.0` · CLI + desktop · 🟢 stable

Extensible autonomous agent from Block, now governed by the Linux Foundation. Installs, executes, edits, and tests — not just suggests.

- **Replaces:** Devin, Cursor agent mode
- **Backends:** Any provider, plus first-class MCP extension support
- **Edge:** More autonomous than aider — plans and iterates with less hand-holding. Vendor-neutral governance under the Linux Foundation means no rug-pull risk, which matters for tooling you standardize a team on.

### [BitFun](https://github.com/GCWing/BitFun)
`Rust + TypeScript` · `MIT` · Desktop + CLI · 🟡 active

Cross-platform coding and desktop agent that plans, edits, tests, and commits inside real Git repositories.

- **Replaces:** Cursor, Claude Desktop
- **Backends:** User-configured model providers; model-agnostic by design
- **Edge:** A Rust runtime binds each conversation to task-specific Mini Apps while retaining filesystem, terminal, Git, browser, desktop, and remote-workspace execution. A self-hostable zero-knowledge relay supports cross-device session control without routing workspace data through a vendor cloud.

### [Orkas](https://github.com/Orkas-AI/Orkas)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · Desktop · 🟡 active

Local-first desktop AI workforce where a Commander plans work and coordinates built-in specialists and external coding agents through one chat.

- **Replaces:** Cursor agent mode, cloud-hosted agent orchestrators
- **Backends:** Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, MiniMax, Doubao, and compatible local model endpoints
- **Edge:** Orkas runs the orchestration layer on the user's machine: conversations, files, agent configuration, and model keys stay local, while the Commander can dispatch Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Cline as local subprocesses alongside built-in agents.

### [ordewell](https://github.com/ordewell/ordewell)
`Rust` · `Apache-2.0` · CLI / TUI · 🟡 active

Plan-first CLI/TUI orchestrator that converts a single goal into an ordered, editable plan of coding-agent tasks.

- **Replaces:** Manual task decomposition and multi-agent CLI scripting
- **Backends:** Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode
- **Edge:** Features a read-only planner that generates explicit step-by-step agent plans before execution, with per-task runner, model, and mode assignment.

### [LoopTroop](https://github.com/looptroop-ai/LoopTroop)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · Desktop + CLI · 🟡 active

Local orchestrator that turns complex coding tickets into verified pull requests using multi-model planning councils and isolated git worktrees.

- **Replaces:** Devin, Cursor agent mode, cloud-hosted agent orchestrators
- **Backends:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and local models via OpenCode
- **Edge:** LoopTroop runs an LLM council where distinct models draft and vote on task plans before implementation starts. Each task executes inside an isolated git worktree with bounded retry loops, so failed runs roll back without touching the primary checkout. Human approval gates pause execution before irreversible terminal commands or branch updates run.

### [Atomic Agent](https://github.com/AtomicBot-ai/atomic-agent)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · CLI + TUI · 🟠 experimental

Local-first coding and desktop agent that runs open-weight models on your machine, with no account or API key needed to install and run it.

- **Replaces:** Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- **Backends:** Bundled `llama.cpp` fork for local quantized models, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, with presets for OpenRouter, LM Studio, and Ollama Cloud
- **Edge:** Ships its own `llama.cpp` fork and manages the backend process itself, so a quantized local model stays usable across long multi-step runs without a separate server setup. The control loop and all state, including a five-layer memory store, stay on the machine, and 56 built-in tools cover browser, filesystem, git, and vision alongside external MCP servers. The README labels it a developer preview: APIs, commands, and config still move between releases.

### [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · VS Code + JetBrains · 🟢 stable

Open-source IDE agent that merged the best of Roo Code and Cline into one extension.

- **Replaces:** Cursor, Windsurf
- **Edge:** Orchestrator mode splits a large task into subtasks handled by specialized modes. Absorbs upstream features from both parents, so it moves faster than either did alone.

### [Tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby)
`Rust` · `Apache-2.0` · Self-hosted server · 🟢 stable

Self-hosted AI coding assistant with its own inference server, no external API calls.

- **Replaces:** GitHub Copilot (enterprise)
- **Edge:** Runs on consumer GPUs, OpenAPI interface, and answers the compliance question ("where does our code go?") with "nowhere."

### [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer)
`Python` · `MIT` · CLI · 🟠 experimental

Describe a project in natural language; it writes and iterates on the whole codebase.

- **Edge:** Best for greenfield scaffolding rather than surgical edits on an existing repo.

---

## Prompt-to-App Builders

Prompt in, deployed full-stack app out.

### [bolt.diy](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Official open-source fork of Bolt.new. Prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web apps in the browser — with the LLM of your choice.

- **Replaces:** Bolt.new, v0, Replit Agent
- **Backends:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Edge:** Self-hostable with zero telemetry. Multi-provider switching mid-project means you can start on a cheap model and escalate only where it matters.

### [Open Design](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · Desktop + web · 🟠 experimental

Turns the coding agent you already have into a design engine — prototypes, landing pages, dashboards, slides, images, and video, exported as HTML/PDF/PPTX/MP4.

- **Replaces:** Claude Design, Figma Make
- **Backends:** BYOK through whatever agent is on your PATH — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OpenCode, Qwen, and 20+ others
- **Edge:** Ships with a large library of brand-grade design-system packages, and every render reads a `DESIGN.md` brand contract, so output is consistent instead of randomly styled. Local-first: your brand assets never leave the machine.

### [OpenUI](https://github.com/wandb/openui)
`Python + TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟡 active

Describe a UI, watch it render live, convert it to React/Svelte/Vue.

- **Replaces:** v0.dev
- **Edge:** Live iteration loop — describe the change, see it immediately. Works with local models via Ollama.

### [Dyad](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · Desktop · 🟢 stable

Local, open-source AI app builder. Runs on your machine, bring your own API keys.

- **Replaces:** Lovable, v0, Bolt
- **Edge:** No vendor lock-in and no cloud round-trip for your source code.

---

## Autonomous & Persistent Agents

Long-running agents with memory, goals, and self-direction.

### [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟡 active

Self-hosted personal AI assistant that runs on any OS and reaches you on any platform. One of the fastest-growing open-source projects ever.

- **Replaces:** ChatGPT desktop, Claude Desktop, Microsoft Copilot
- **Backends:** Any OpenAI-compatible API, Ollama, LocalAI
- **Edge:** Gateways into Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, email, and CLI, so the agent reaches you where you already are — and can proactively message *you*. Large skill/plugin ecosystem. **Security note:** it holds credentials for your messaging accounts and runs autonomously; sandbox it and read the permission model before pointing it at anything sensitive.

### [Hivekeep](https://github.com/MarlBurroW/hivekeep)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟡 active

Self-hosted platform to run a *team* of specialized AI agents that collaborate, keep persistent memory, and build their own tools, mini-apps, and plugins.

- **Replaces:** ChatGPT Team, Claude Desktop, hosted agent platforms
- **Backends:** Any OpenAI-compatible API, Ollama
- **Edge:** Multiple agents delegate to each other and share memory across months; a built-in web UI plus Telegram, Slack, Discord, and Matrix channels. Ships as a single container (Bun + SQLite), so the whole platform runs on modest hardware.

### [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟡 active

Nous Research's self-improving agent — persistent memory, reusable skills, cron jobs, and 20+ messaging surfaces.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI Operator, Claude Desktop
- **Edge:** Closed learning loop: it creates skills from experience, refines them in use, and persists memory and session history in SQLite across restarts. Runs on a cheap VPS or serverless with no idle cost.

### [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟡 active

ByteDance's long-horizon "SuperAgent" harness — sandboxes, memory, skills, subagents, and a message gateway for tasks that run for minutes to hours.

- **Edge:** Built on LangGraph, but ships the whole runtime an agent actually needs (filesystem, memory, sandboxed execution, subagent spawning) instead of leaving you to assemble it. Hit #1 on GitHub Trending on the 2.0 release.

### [Open-Sable](https://github.com/IdeoaLabs/Open-Sable)
`Python` · Local-first agent framework · 🟡 active

Autonomous agent with AGI-inspired cognitive subsystems — goals, working/episodic/long-term memory, metacognition, and tool use.

- **Edge:** Ollama-first with cloud fallback and a low-VRAM mode, so it genuinely runs on your own hardware. Memory decay and consolidation plus a watchdog/hot-reload supervisor make 24/7 operation realistic rather than aspirational.

### [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)
`Python + TypeScript` · MIT (classic agent) / Polyform Shield (platform) · 🟢 stable

The project that started the autonomous-agent wave, now a low-code platform for building and running continuous agents.

- **Edge:** Visual block-based builder plus a library of pre-built agents. Note the license split — the classic agent is MIT, the newer platform is source-available, not OSI.

### [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) (formerly MemGPT)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Stateful agents with real long-term memory — the agent manages its own context window, paging memories in and out.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI Assistants API
- **Edge:** Memory is a first-class primitive backed by a database, not a vector-search bolt-on. Agents persist across sessions and are portable between models.

### [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
`Python + TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Memory layer you drop into any agent — extracts, stores, and retrieves facts about users across sessions.

- **Edge:** Framework-agnostic. Hybrid vector + graph store beats naively stuffing the chat log into a vector DB.

### [kgai](https://github.com/kgaidev/kgai)
`Go` · `MIT` · Claude Code plugin + CLI · 🟡 active

Local-first shared decision memory for engineering teams using Claude Code. An append-only log of architectural decisions and the alternatives that were rejected, projected into a knowledge graph the agent queries before it makes a change.

- **Edge:** The log is append-only and decisions are superseded, never edited or deleted, so a rejected approach stays in history with the reason it died. Teams sync the store over an S3 bucket they own, with no central server and no daemon. Capture rules live in a committed, per-repo config you approve before it runs.
### [Mnemoverse](https://github.com/mnemoverse/mcp-memory-server)
`TypeScript + Python` · `MIT` (client) · 🟢 stable

Hosted memory reached over MCP: one key gives Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code and ChatGPT the same store, so what an agent learns in one is there in the next.

- **Edge:** Recall ranking moves with outcomes, not similarity alone. A memory that helped is promoted, one that misled is demoted, so ranking is a function of consequences.

### [Khoj](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj)
`Python` · `AGPL-3.0` · 🟢 stable

Self-hosted personal AI that searches your notes, documents, and the web; reachable from browser, Obsidian, and Emacs.

- **Replaces:** ChatGPT with memory, Notion AI
- **Edge:** Indexes *your* corpus locally. Runs fully offline with local models.

---

## Agent Sandboxes & Browser Control

Where agent-generated code actually runs, and how agents touch the web.

### [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B)
`TypeScript + Go` · `Apache-2.0` · SDK + self-hostable infra · 🟢 stable

Secure cloud sandboxes for running AI-generated code, built on Firecracker microVMs.

- **Replaces:** proprietary code-interpreter backends
- **Edge:** microVM isolation gives each sandbox its own kernel — a genuine security boundary, not just a container namespace. That distinction matters the moment you execute code a model wrote. Python and JS SDKs, plus [e2b-dev/infra](https://github.com/e2b-dev/infra) if you need to run the whole platform yourself.

### [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona)
`Go + TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · Server + SDK · 🟠 experimental

Sandbox runtime for AI agents with fast warm-pool starts and filesystems that persist across sessions.

- **Replaces:** E2B (when you need persistence over isolation strength)
- **Edge:** sandboxes can pause, resume, and outlive a single session, which is what long-horizon agents actually need. Container-based rather than microVM, so treat the isolation as weaker than E2B's — fine for your own code, think twice for genuinely untrusted input.

### [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
`Python` · `MIT` · Library · 🟡 active

Connects an LLM to a real browser so it can navigate, fill forms, and extract data.

- **Replaces:** Stagehand, MultiOn
- **Edge:** the most widely used open browser agent, with multi-tab handling and vision fallback when the DOM isn't enough. **Known weakness:** non-deterministic — the same goal takes different paths on different runs, which makes failures hard to reproduce, and vision calls on complex pages get expensive. Budget for retries and cap your spend.

### [Skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern)
`Python` · `AGPL-3.0` · Library + server · 🟢 stable

Browser automation driven by computer vision instead of DOM selectors.

- **Replaces:** Stagehand, brittle Playwright scraping suites
- **Edge:** because it navigates visually, a site redesign doesn't break your selectors — the usual reason scraping pipelines rot. **Check the license:** AGPL-3.0, and the anti-bot pieces are held back for the paid cloud. That combination rules it out for some commercial use.

### [Open Interpreter](https://github.com/openinterpreter/openinterpreter)
`Python` · `MIT` · CLI + Desktop · 🟢 stable

Lets Language Models run code locally on your computer to edit videos, analyze data, and control browsers.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI Code Interpreter (Advanced Data Analysis)
- **Backends:** Local models (Ollama, LM Studio) or hosted APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Edge:** Runs directly in your local terminal environment with full access to system utilities, internet, and python packages without cloud execution limits.

### [Superagent](https://github.com/pungme/superagent-desktop)
`TypeScript + Swift` · `MIT` · Desktop app · 🟡 active

macOS desktop app that gives Claude Code and Codex a real browser to drive, an iOS Simulator to install and screenshot apps in, and a phone companion app for remote monitoring.

- **Replaces:** cloud sandbox services for agents that specifically need a real, controllable macOS browser/iOS Simulator rather than a headless container
- **Backends:** Claude Code, Codex
- **Edge:** unlike headless sandboxes, the browser and Simulator are visible and drivable on the user's own Mac, so the agent can screenshot real rendered UI and iOS app behavior instead of a DOM approximation.

---

## Agent Frameworks & Orchestration

Libraries for building multi-agent and tool-using systems.

### [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
`Python + JS` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Build agents as stateful graphs — nodes, edges, and explicit control flow, with checkpointing and human-in-the-loop interrupts.

- **Edge:** Durable execution: an agent can pause for hours awaiting human approval and resume with full state. The right choice when you need a *reliable* agent, not a demo.

### [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Role-playing autonomous agents that collaborate — a "crew" with defined roles, goals, and tasks.

- **Replaces:** AutoGen, OpenAI Swarm
- **Edge:** Independent of LangChain, lean runtime. The role/task abstraction is the most intuitive on-ramp to multi-agent design. Flows give you event-driven control when crews are too loose.

### [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
`Python + .NET` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Microsoft's framework for multi-agent conversation — agents talk to each other, execute code, and involve humans.

- **Edge:** Async event-driven core with a distributed runtime and cross-language support. AutoGen Studio gives a no-code prototyping UI.

### [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Hugging Face's minimal agent library — the core logic is about a thousand lines.

- **Edge:** The fastest path to a working single-agent loop. Code agents write Python actions instead of emitting JSON tool calls, which is measurably more reliable for multi-step tasks. Read it end-to-end in an afternoon.

### [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python)
`Python + Java` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Code-first toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying multi-agent systems.

- **Edge:** Model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic despite the Google name. Built-in evaluation and a local dev UI close the "how do I know my agent got worse?" gap that most frameworks ignore.

### [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Agent framework from the Pydantic team — type-safe, structured outputs, dependency injection.

- **Edge:** If you already trust Pydantic for validation, this brings the same rigor to LLM I/O. Feels like FastAPI for agents.

### [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Program LLMs instead of prompting them — declare modules and let optimizers compile the prompts.

- **Edge:** Replaces manual prompt-tweaking with systematic optimization against a metric. Swap the model, recompile, keep the quality.

### [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

One OpenAI-compatible interface for 100+ LLM providers, plus a proxy with keys, budgets, rate limits, and fallbacks.

- **Replaces:** OpenRouter (hosted)
- **Edge:** The single most useful piece of plumbing in the stack. Provider outage → automatic fallback. Per-team budgets and spend tracking come free.

### [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Production-oriented framework for composable RAG and agent pipelines.

- **Edge:** Explicit, inspectable pipeline graphs. Strong retriever/ranker ecosystem — favored when search quality is the hard part.

---

## Agent Skills & Package Management

Tools for publishing, versioning, discovering, and installing reusable instructions and configuration across AI coding assistants.

### [AIPM](https://github.com/abhisri2090/aipm)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · CLI + registry · 🟡 active

Package manager and public registry for reusable AI skills, prompts, rules, MCP setup, and tool files.

- **Edge:** One versioned package can target Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor through adapters, while the lockfile records exact installed versions for repeatable team setup.

---

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The emerging standard for connecting models to tools and data.

### [MCP Specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol)
`MIT` · 🟢 stable

The protocol itself — open standard for exposing tools, resources, and prompts to any LLM client.

- **Edge:** Write an integration once; every MCP-capable client (Claude Code, OpenCode, Cline, Continue, and more) can use it.

### [MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
`MIT` · 🟡 active

Reference implementations — filesystem, git, fetch, memory, and dozens of community servers.

- **Edge:** The fastest way to learn the protocol is to read a 200-line server that already works.

### [Mac Developer Bridge](https://github.com/alexanderradahl/mac-developer-bridge)
`JavaScript` · `MIT` · macOS / MCP · 🟠 experimental

Local MCP bridge that lets an existing ChatGPT conversation operate the Mac where the developer is already working: shell, unrestricted files, real PTY sessions, background jobs, and read-only Codex history.

- **Edge:** ChatGPT stays the reasoning layer and the bridge makes no model calls. Unlike a narrow filesystem or shell MCP, it is deliberately built for developer-machine parity and real interactive terminals. **Security tradeoff:** it is intentionally not sandboxed and runs with the macOS user's effective permissions, so it is only appropriate when that level of machine access is explicitly wanted.

### [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟡 active

Official developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

- **Edge:** shows you the actual protocol traffic — tool calls, resources, errors — instead of leaving you guessing why a client won't load your server. First thing to reach for when an MCP integration silently does nothing.

### [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟡 active

The ergonomic way to build MCP servers and clients — decorator-based, like FastAPI.

- **Edge:** A working server in ~10 lines. Handles auth, deployment, proxying, and server composition.

### [octocode](https://github.com/Muvon/octocode)
`Rust` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟠 experimental

Local semantic code index with an MCP server on top — search and navigate a codebase by meaning, not grep.

- **Replaces:** the codebase indexing inside Cursor or Sourcegraph Cody
- **Backends:** local embeddings via fastembed, or a hosted provider if you'd rather offload it
- **Edge:** runs entirely locally, and embeddings are your choice. **Known weakness:** first index on a large repo is slow, and semantic search is genuinely bad at structural questions — "find every implementation of this trait" wants a structural index, not embeddings, so you need separate structural tools and have to know which kind of question you're asking before you search. Early-stage; treat it accordingly.

---

## Local Inference Engines

Run models on your own hardware.

### [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)
`Go` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Download and run open models with one command. The default entry point to local LLMs.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI API (for local workloads)
- **Edge:** `ollama run <model>` and you're done — it handles fetching, quantization, GPU offload, and serving an OpenAI-compatible API. The largest model library and the widest tool support of any local runtime.

### [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
`C/C++` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

The inference engine most local tooling is built on. Runs LLMs on CPU, CUDA, Metal, ROCm, Vulkan, and more.

- **Edge:** Extreme portability — a laptop, a Raspberry Pi, a Mac Studio, a server farm. GGUF quantization is the reason a large model fits on consumer hardware.

### [Jan](https://github.com/menloresearch/jan)
`TypeScript` · `AGPL-3.0` · Desktop · 🟢 stable

Offline ChatGPT alternative that runs entirely on your machine.

- **Replaces:** ChatGPT desktop, LM Studio (which is only partially open)
- **Edge:** Fully open desktop UX with local-first data storage, plus an optional OpenAI-compatible local server.

### [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm)
`Python + C++` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Universal LLM deployment engine — native GPU acceleration on iOS, Android, desktop, and the browser.

- **Replaces:** Ollama (on mobile), cloud inference for on-device apps
- **Edge:** the only serious path to running an LLM on a phone's GPU. **Known weakness:** model support is limited to what's been compiled for the target, and when compilation or inference fails the errors are opaque.

### [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

LLM inference entirely in the browser via WebGPU.

- **Edge:** no server, no API key, no data leaving the tab — which makes a whole class of privacy-sensitive apps possible. **Known weakness:** requires WebGPU, so Safari and Firefox support is the limiting factor, and out-of-memory device-lost errors are common on modest GPUs.

### [llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile)
`C/C++` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Distribute an entire LLM as one executable file that runs on multiple OSes without installation.

- **Edge:** Unbeatable for shipping a model to a non-technical user. One file. Double-click. Done.

### [Rapid-MLX](https://github.com/raullenchai/Rapid-MLX)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟡 active

OpenAI-compatible inference server built specifically for Apple Silicon, on Apple's MLX framework.

- **Replaces:** Ollama / LM Studio (on a Mac)
- **Edge:** MLX-native quantization tuned for the unified-memory envelope, with grammar-constrained tool calling, reasoning separation, and vision — verified end-to-end against Claude Code, Cursor, Aider and Codex. `brew install rapid-mlx`, then `rapid-mlx serve <model>`.

---

## Inference Servers & Gateways

Serving models at scale.

### [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)
`Python + CUDA` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

High-throughput, memory-efficient inference and serving engine — the de facto standard for self-hosted production LLM serving.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI API, Together AI
- **Edge:** PagedAttention plus continuous batching gives order-of-magnitude throughput gains over naive serving. Tensor/pipeline parallelism scales across GPUs; the OpenAI-compatible API means clients need no changes.

### [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Fast serving framework with RadixAttention prefix caching and a structured generation language.

- **Edge:** Wins on workloads with heavy shared prefixes (agents, few-shot, multi-turn) where prefix-cache reuse dominates. Excellent constrained-decoding support.

### [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI)
`Go` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API that runs locally across many backends and modalities — text, image, audio, embeddings.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI API, ElevenLabs API
- **Edge:** One server, many backends (llama.cpp, vLLM, transformers, whisper, diffusers). No GPU required. Point your existing OpenAI SDK at it and change nothing else.

### [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
`Rust + Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Hugging Face's production serving stack — the engine behind their inference endpoints.

- **Edge:** Battle-tested Rust web server, token streaming, and tight integration with the HF ecosystem.

### [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Distributed compute framework for scaling AI workloads — training, tuning, and multi-model serving via Ray Serve.

- **Edge:** For when one model on one box is no longer the problem. Model composition and autoscaling across a cluster.

### [Unified AI System](https://github.com/happy520ai/unified-ai-system)
`TypeScript + JavaScript` · `Apache-2.0` · `Self-hosted gateway + CLI` · 🟡 active

Terminal-first AI gateway that puts provider routing, governed agent and knowledge contracts, an HTTP API, and Codex MCP tools behind one self-hosted service.

- **Replaces:** ad hoc provider-specific proxy scripts when evaluating a local AI gateway control plane
- **Backends:** deterministic local fake provider by default; configurable adapters for NVIDIA and OpenAI-compatible upstream providers
- **Edge:** A fresh clone can prove the complete chat and MCP paths without credentials, while the CLI refuses to send when a real provider may be active unless the operator supplies `--allow-real-provider` for that command. Public-clone and container smoke checks keep the credential-free path under CI.

### [Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)
`Go` · `Apache-2.0` · `Self-hosted gateway` · 🟢 stable

OpenAI-compatible AI gateway for routing requests across multiple model providers with failover, guardrails, usage controls, observability, and MCP support.

- **Replaces:** provider-specific AI API integrations and proxy scripts
- **Edge:** Go-native gateway with one OpenAI-compatible endpoint, automatic failover and load balancing, plus governance and telemetry controls for production traffic.

---

## Chat UIs & Frontends

### [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)
`Python + Svelte` · `BSD-3-Clause` (with branding clause) · 🟢 stable

Feature-rich, self-hosted AI interface — the default UI for Ollama and OpenAI-compatible backends.

- **Replaces:** ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro
- **Edge:** Multi-user with RBAC, built-in RAG over uploaded documents, web search, image generation, voice, and a Python function/pipeline plugin system. Runs fully offline.

### [LibreChat](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Every AI provider in one polished ChatGPT-style interface.

- **Replaces:** ChatGPT Plus, Poe
- **Edge:** Multi-provider in a single conversation, agents, code interpreter, artifacts, MCP support, and genuinely good multi-user auth. MIT with no branding restrictions.

### [Lobe Chat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` (with conditions) · 🟢 stable

Modern chat framework with a plugin and agent-market ecosystem.

- **Edge:** The best-looking option, with PWA and mobile support plus one-click Vercel deploy.

### [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm)
`JavaScript` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

All-in-one desktop and Docker app: chat with your documents, with agents and multi-user workspaces built in.

- **Edge:** Batteries-included RAG — embedder, vector DB, and UI ship together. Fastest path from "I have PDFs" to "I can ask them questions."

### [ThoughtDAG](https://github.com/chenxiachan/thoughtdag)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · Web · 🟠 experimental

A local-first visual LLM workspace where graph edges define what context the model receives.

- **Replaces:** linear chat interfaces for long-running LLM research
- **Backends:** Ollama and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Edge:** Graph edges are execution semantics, not decoration: traversing a node's upstream DAG constructs the message history for the next request, so users can branch, merge, and prune context explicitly.

### [Persona](https://github.com/jayamitkatariya/personacli)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟡 active

Local-first workspace combining notes, tasks, and AI chat in your browser on your machine.

- **Replaces:** Notion AI, Obsidian + Copilot plugin
- **Edge:** Plain markdown files on disk — no accounts, no cloud, no database. The AI reads and edits your actual workspace files. Supports Ollama for fully local inference.

---

## Vector Databases

### [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)
`Rust` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Vector search engine with rich payload filtering, built for production.

- **Replaces:** Pinecone
- **Edge:** Written in Rust — predictable latency under load. Scalar/product/binary quantization cuts RAM dramatically. Filtered search stays accurate instead of degrading like naive pre/post-filtering.

### [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)
`Go + C++` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Distributed vector database built for billion-scale workloads.

- **Edge:** Separated storage and compute, GPU indexing — the heaviest-duty option when the corpus genuinely is enormous. Milvus Lite covers local dev.

### [Weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)
`Go` · `BSD-3-Clause` · 🟢 stable

Vector database with built-in vectorization modules and a GraphQL API.

- **Edge:** Module system embeds data for you at ingest. Native hybrid (BM25 + vector) search and multi-tenancy.

### [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)
`Rust + Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

The batteries-included embedding database for AI applications.

- **Edge:** `pip install chromadb` and you have a working vector store in four lines. The right default for prototypes; scale out later if you must.

### [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
`C` · `PostgreSQL License` · 🟢 stable

Vector similarity search inside PostgreSQL.

- **Edge:** No new infrastructure. Your embeddings live next to your relational data with real transactions, joins, and backups. Start here unless you've measured a reason not to.

### [MongrelDB](https://github.com/visorcraft/MongrelDB)
`Rust` · `MIT OR Apache-2.0` · Embedded + server · 🟠 experimental

Columnar database with AI-native retrieval — dense ANN, sparse vectors, full-text, and metadata filters in one transactional engine.

- **Replaces:** Pinecone + a separate operational DB for RAG/agent memory
- **Edge:** Not a pure vector store — dense ANN, sparse, and full-text indexes share one transactional row store, so hybrid search with RRF fusion runs without a separate vector service, keeping SQL, encryption-at-rest, and multi-user access. Companion [MongrelDB Viewer](https://github.com/visorcraft/MongrelDB-Viewer) for schema, SQL, and ANN exploration.

---

## Embeddings & Rerankers

The retrieval quality layer. Swapping your embedding model usually beats swapping your vector database.

### [FlagEmbedding / BGE](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

The BGE family — BGE-M3 embeddings and the BGE reranker models.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI text-embedding-3, Cohere Embed, Cohere Rerank
- **Edge:** BGE-M3 does dense, sparse (lexical), and multi-vector retrieval from one model across 100+ languages, so you get hybrid search without running two systems. Pairing BGE-M3 with a BGE reranker is the default open retrieval stack, and it runs on your own hardware with no per-query cost.

### [Sentence Transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

The library for computing, training, and fine-tuning text embeddings.

- **Edge:** the interface almost every open embedding model ships against — learn it once and every model on Hugging Face is available. Fine-tuning an embedding model on your own domain is usually the single highest-leverage RAG improvement, and this is how you do it.

---

## RAG Frameworks

### [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
`Python + TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

The data framework for LLM applications — ingestion, indexing, retrieval, and agentic workflows over your data.

- **Edge:** Hundreds of data connectors (LlamaHub) and the deepest library of retrieval strategies — hierarchical, recursive, hybrid, auto-merging. When naive top-k retrieval isn't good enough, the fix is usually already implemented here.

### [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

RAG engine built on deep document understanding — layout-aware parsing of PDFs, tables, and scans.

- **Edge:** Document parsing is where most RAG systems actually fail. RAGFlow treats it as the core problem and shows you citation-grounded chunks so you can debug retrieval visually.

### [Dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)
`Python + TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` (with conditions) · 🟢 stable

Production-ready platform for agentic workflows — visual builder, RAG pipeline, model management, and observability in one.

- **Replaces:** OpenAI GPTs platform, Vertex AI Agent Builder
- **Edge:** Non-engineers can build and ship an internal AI tool without touching code, while engineers keep API access to everything. Self-hosted, so your data stays put.

### [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling)
`Python` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Parse PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, and images into structured, LLM-ready formats.

- **Edge:** Layout and table-structure models that handle real-world documents. Plugs directly into LlamaIndex and LangChain.

### [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Preprocessing library for ingesting unstructured documents into ML pipelines.

- **Edge:** Broadest format coverage. The workhorse behind many production ingestion pipelines.

---

## Fine-Tuning & Training

### [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Fine-tune LLMs roughly 2x faster with far less VRAM, without accuracy loss.

- **Edge:** Hand-written Triton kernels and a manual backprop engine. Makes fine-tuning a mid-size model on a single free Colab GPU realistic instead of aspirational.

### [Axolotl](https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Post-training framework configured entirely through YAML — full fine-tune, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO, ORPO, and more.

### [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Hugging Face's parameter-efficient fine-tuning library — LoRA, QLoRA, adapters, prompt tuning.

- **Edge:** The reference implementation everything else builds on. Integrates directly with Transformers, Accelerate, and TRL.

### [Distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Synthetic data pipelines for SFT and preference tuning, from the Argilla team.

- **Edge:** treats dataset generation as a reproducible pipeline rather than a pile of one-off scripts, and loops through Argilla so a human can curate what the model generated. The bottleneck in fine-tuning is almost always data, not compute.

### [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Train transformer models with reinforcement learning — SFT, DPO, GRPO, reward modeling.

- **Edge:** The standard path from a base model to an aligned, instruction-following one.

---

## Evals, Testing & Guardrails

### [promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` · 🟢 stable

Test and evaluate prompts, agents, and RAG systems — plus LLM red teaming and vulnerability scanning.

- **Edge:** Declarative test cases in YAML that run in CI. Side-by-side model comparison plus adversarial red-teaming in one tool. Local-first — your prompts never leave your machine.

`TypeScript` · `FSL-1.1-ALv2` (fair-code; converts to `Apache-2.0`) · CLI, dashboard, MCP · 🟠 experimental

The self-improving QA agent for software teams, with natural-language web and mobile tests that adapt when user interfaces change.

- **Backends:** OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible endpoints, Gemini, and local models
- **Edge:** Stores product, suite, test, and healed-step observations as versioned execution memory, then reuses that context on later runs. Ships a dashboard, CLI, MCP server, and three agent skills in one repository.

### [ClawBench](https://github.com/reacher-z/ClawBench)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · Docker/browser harness · 🟡 active

Evaluate web agents on 153 everyday tasks across 144 live websites, with the final submission request intercepted to keep runs side-effect-free.

- **Edge:** Captures session replay, screenshots, HTTP traffic, browser actions, and agent messages in one reproducible run, making failures diagnosable beyond a final pass/fail score.

### [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

"Pytest for LLMs" — unit-test LLM outputs with research-backed metrics.

- **Edge:** Feels like a normal test suite. G-Eval, faithfulness, answer relevancy, hallucination, and RAG-specific metrics run locally on the model of your choice.

### [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Evaluation toolkit for RAG pipelines.

- **Edge:** Splits retrieval quality from generation quality, so you know which half to fix. Can synthesize a test set from your own documents.

### [Guardrails](https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Add input/output validators to LLM applications — structure, safety, PII, and custom rules.

- **Edge:** Validators are composable and re-ask the model on failure rather than just erroring out.

### [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Programmable rails for conversational systems, defined in the Colang modeling language.

- **Edge:** Dialogue-level control — keep a bot on topic, block jailbreaks, enforce a conversation flow.

### [Garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak)
`Python` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

LLM vulnerability scanner — probes for prompt injection, jailbreaks, data leakage, and toxicity.

- **Edge:** `nmap` for language models. Run it before you ship, not after the incident.

---

## Observability & LLMOps

### [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)
`TypeScript` · `MIT` (core) · 🟢 stable

Open-source LLM engineering platform — tracing, evals, prompt management, and cost tracking.

- **Replaces:** LangSmith
- **Edge:** MIT-licensed core that you can genuinely self-host. Framework-agnostic via OpenTelemetry. Nested traces make multi-agent debugging tractable, and prompt versioning decouples prompt changes from deploys.

### [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix)
`Python + TypeScript` · `Elastic-2.0` · 🟢 stable

AI observability and evaluation, built on OpenTelemetry and OpenInference.

- **Edge:** Runs in a notebook for local debugging or as a server for production. Strong embedding-drift and retrieval-quality visualizations.

### [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry)
`Python + TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

OpenTelemetry instrumentation for LLM applications.

- **Edge:** Standards-based — ship traces to Datadog, Honeycomb, Grafana, or whatever you already run. No new observability vendor.

### [agent-watch](https://github.com/soul-sol/agent-watch)
`POSIX shell` · `MIT` · CLI · 🟠 experimental

Monitors background Claude Code and Codex jobs as RUNNING, DONE, FAILED, or STALL from process, exit-code, and log-tail signals.

- **Edge:** Separates transport failures from credential failures before workers start by probing without credentials in the child process, then runs the optional auth probe only after reachability succeeds.

### [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` · 🟢 stable

Observability platform for LLM apps — one-line proxy integration, caching, and rate limiting.

- **Edge:** Change your base URL and you have logging. Lowest-friction start of any tool in this section.

### [Mydentify AI Model Cost Calculator](https://github.com/mitdralla/mydentify-ai-model-cost-calculator)
`JavaScript` · `MIT` · Browser app · 🟠 experimental

Dependency-free browser calculator for estimating AI model API costs from request volume, input and output tokens, cached input, and fixed per-request charges.

- **Edge:** Runs locally without API keys, accounts, cookies, analytics, or server-side processing. The tested formula separates cached from uncached input and keeps provider-specific pricing assumptions visible so estimates can be reviewed before a real bill is incurred.

---

## Speech, Vision & Multimodal

### [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) / [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) / [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp)
`MIT` · 🟢 stable

Speech-to-text: the original model, the CTranslate2 port (substantially faster), and the C++ port (runs anywhere).

- **Replaces:** Google Speech-to-Text, AssemblyAI
- **Edge:** State-of-the-art multilingual ASR for free, on your own hardware. `whisper.cpp` runs real-time transcription on a laptop CPU.

### [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX)
`Python` · `BSD-2-Clause` · 🟢 stable

Whisper plus word-level timestamps and speaker diarization.

- **Edge:** If you need to know *who* said *what, when* — subtitles, meeting notes — this is the one.

### [Kokoro](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) / [Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl)
`Apache-2.0` / `GPL-3.0` · 🟢 stable

Text-to-speech. Kokoro is a tiny (~82M parameter) model with quality far above its weight class; Piper is optimized for devices as small as a Raspberry Pi.

- **Replaces:** ElevenLabs
- **Edge:** Real-time TTS on CPU. Kokoro's small footprint makes it viable to bundle inside an app.

### [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat)
`Python` · Library · 🟢 stable

Framework for real-time voice and multimodal conversational agents.

- **Replaces:** Vapi, Retell
- **Edge:** pluggable STT/TTS/LLM stages over WebRTC, plus speech-to-speech model support, so you can assemble a voice agent from open parts instead of renting a platform. **Known weakness:** maintainers' own issue tracker documents pipeline freezes, zombie function-call handlers after timeout, and multi-second latency in production. The linear pipeline model also fits multi-party conversation badly. Expect real engineering effort.

### [LiveKit Agents](https://github.com/livekit/agents)
`Python + Node` · `Apache-2.0` · Framework · 🟢 stable

Realtime agent framework built on LiveKit's WebRTC infrastructure.

- **Replaces:** Vapi, Retell
- **Edge:** the room/participant model handles multi-party and interruption natively, where a linear pipeline has to fake it. If your voice agent needs more than one human in the call, start here rather than with a pipeline framework.

### [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)
`Python` · `GPL-3.0` · 🟢 stable

Node-based interface for diffusion models — image, video, and audio generation pipelines.

### [Surya](https://github.com/datalab-to/surya)
`Python` · `GPL-3.0` (commercial exceptions) · 🟡 active

Document OCR, layout analysis, and reading-order detection in 90+ languages.

- **Edge:** Layout, reading order, and table structure — not just raw character recognition. Essential upstream of any document RAG.

---

## Low-Code / Visual Builders

### [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n)
`TypeScript` · `Sustainable Use License` (fair-code, source-available) · 🟢 stable

Workflow automation with native AI agent nodes — hundreds of integrations, self-hostable.

- **Replaces:** Zapier, Make
- **Edge:** Drop to JavaScript in any node when the visual builder runs out. AI agent nodes make it a legitimate agent runtime, not just a trigger-action tool. **Note:** fair-code, not OSI-approved — read the license before commercial use.

### [Flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)
`TypeScript` · `Apache-2.0` (with conditions) · 🟢 stable

Drag-and-drop builder for LLM flows and agents.

- **Edge:** Fastest way to prototype a RAG chatbot visually and expose it as an API or embeddable widget.

## Choosing Your Stack

Start small. Every layer below is optional until it isn't.

**Solo developer, local-first, zero API cost**
```
Ollama → Continue (editor) + aider (terminal) → Open WebUI (chat)
```

**Small team shipping an AI product**
```
LiteLLM proxy → LangGraph or CrewAI → pgvector → Langfuse → promptfoo in CI
```

**Enterprise, self-hosted, compliance-bound**
```
vLLM (own GPUs) → LiteLLM (keys/budgets) → Qdrant → Dify or LangGraph
  → Langfuse (tracing) → Garak + NeMo Guardrails (safety)
```

**Document-heavy RAG**
```
Docling or RAGFlow (parsing) → LlamaIndex (retrieval) → Qdrant → Ragas (eval)
```

Three rules that save the most time:

1. **Put a gateway in front of your models from day one.** LiteLLM costs an afternoon and buys you provider switching, budgets, and fallbacks forever.
2. **Use Postgres + pgvector until you have measured a reason not to.** Most "we need a vector database" problems are actually retrieval-quality problems.
3. **Add tracing before you add features.** Debugging an untraced multi-agent system is guesswork.
